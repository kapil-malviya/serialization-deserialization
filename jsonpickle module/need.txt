Need of jsonpickle module : 
- in json module dump and load function always works with python dict object
- we can't convert our object to json directly with the help of json module


jsonpickle module :

By using jsonpickle module we can serialize our custom class objects directly
to json and we can deserialize json to our custom class objects directly

jsonpickle module is not available bydefault & have to install it explicitly

	---$ pip install jsonpickle

It contains following functions :
- encode() meant for serialization
- decode() meant for deserialization

Example :
- encode() : encode function convert our employee object to json directly without 
    converting employee object into python dictionary.
- decode() : decode function meant for reverse operation, from json to employee 
	object directly.
