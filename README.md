# Serialization and Deserialization in Python


Welcome to the **serialization-deserialization**  in Python repository! This repository contains a collection of codes 
and explanations related to the concepts of serialization and deserialization in Python. We explore the usage of the 
`json` module for JSON serialization and deserialization, as well as pickling and unpickling objects using Python's 
`pickle` module.

## Introduction

Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects, dictionaries, or lists, into a format 
that can be easily stored or transmitted. Deserialization, on the other hand, involves reconstructing the original data 
structure from the serialized format.

In this repository, we explore two common methods of serialization and deserialization:

1. **JSON Serialization and Deserialization:** We demonstrate how to use Python's built-in `json` module to serialize Python
   objects into JSON format and deserialize JSON data back into Python objects.

3. **Pickling and Unpickling:** We delve into pickling, a Python-specific serialization process, using the `pickle` module.
   Pickling allows you to serialize and deserialize Python objects, maintaining their state.


## Usage

Each subdirectory within this repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate specific serialization and deserialization 
concepts. To run these examples, follow these steps :

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kapil-malviya/serialization-deserialization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired subdirectory:
   ```bash
   cd serialization-deserialization/json-module-for-serialization
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 serialize.py
   ```
